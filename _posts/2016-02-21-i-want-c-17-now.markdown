title: I want C++17 Now!

I know, I know, we don't even have proper working implementations of C++14 and there are a lot of proposals. These things take time, I know, I know.

But I must say, whenever I read one of the proposals, I just think: Fuck yeah, we need this. It really triggers my Autism. It annoys me I have to wait so long.

Still, better wait a while and get a proper standard than rush it and end up with unusable crap.
