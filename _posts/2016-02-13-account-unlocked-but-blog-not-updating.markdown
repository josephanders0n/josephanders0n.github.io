Github has unlocked my account after I've proven my humanity once more. Unfortunately the blog is not showing the posts I write. I know a 10 minute delay is normal, but I've been waiting for about 8 hours now. Tinypress is cool, but there are issues that need to be worked out before it becomes viable. I'm not giving up just yet though.
